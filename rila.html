          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Rila Estansia is a wild-hearted Brazilian woman from the Amazon Forest. A protector of nature, Rila enters
            the FIST Tournament to find out about the evil spirit that is threatening the Amazonian people.</p>
          <p>Rila's alt, Virgo Sandra, is a woman who was entrusted to the "forest tribe" as an orphan and was raised by
            a giant snake. She possesses the so-called "Green Gem". Her surname, "Sandra", comes from the village where
            she lives.</p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            Rila is a character known for her high damage output and potent pokes. 
            Although her movement is relatively slow, she compensates by taking risks with her special moves, 
            which require charging. She may struggle against zoning characters, 
            but her strong anti-air capabilities and impressive damage output make her excel in both close and mid-range combat.
          </p>

          <h2 id="pokes">Pokes</h2>
          <p><u>cr.HP : </u>This move is seriously annoying for your opponent. 
            It's hard to punish when whiffed and safe on block. 
            It can shut down many approaches. 
            Use it wisely, it's most effective from a distance and works decently as an anti-air from afar.
          </p>
          <p><u>Neutral jump HP : </u> This can beat most normals and some anti-air specials 
            when they're out of their invincibility frames.
          </p>

          <h2 id="quick_scratch">Quick Scratch</h4>
          <p>
          <u>Quick Scratch LP ([4].6LP)</u>: Can catch your opponent by surprise due to its speed.
            It's safe on block in most matchups, except against Saizo and Tia.
          </p>
          <p>
          <u>Quick Scratch HP ([4].6HP)</u>: Can be used as anti-air (combo into super Bloody fang)
            Deals significantly more damage than the LP version, but it is unsafe.
          </p>

          <h2 id="killer_snake">Kiler Snake</h2>
         <p>
            <u>Killer Snake ( [4].3HK ) : </u>This move is used to punish projectiles, and it can also surprise the opponent up close.<br>
            It can be confirmed into a super grab (Bloody Fang). <br>
            Be careful, Killer snake is unsafe on block, your opponent has few frames to punish this move.<br><br>
            Many Rila players often risk attempting a super immediately after landing it on block, 
            aiming to counter any poorly timed punishment or mistakes due to a lack of matchup knowledge.
          </p>

          <h2 id="anti-air">Anti-air</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>[4].8LK or HK depending on the range</li>
            <li>Close st.HK (anti cross-up)</li>
            <li>Close st.HP (Special and Super cancelable)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: Close st.HK covers more range than close st.HP.
            Use it to counter ambiguous jump-in/cross-ups</p>

          <h2 id="supers">Super usage</h2>
          <p><u>Bloody Fang : </u> For punishing projectiles and extending combos</p>
          <p><u>Shine beast : </u> This super is risky and has few practical applications, but it can still be used as a
            reversal due to its invincible startup.</p>


          <h2 id="chip">Chip damage</h2>
          <p>Spinning Claw does the most chip damage,
            but it's not reliable due to its inconsistency.
            You should use Killer Snake HK or cr.LP > Quick Scratch HP.
          </p>
