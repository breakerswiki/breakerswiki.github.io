          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Saizo Tobikageno, a ninja driven by the desire for vengeance, pursues justice for the annihilation of his clan.
          </p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            Saizo shines as the top zoning character, with his anti-air sword covering a large area, 
            and his kunai passing through other projectiles. 
            His speed, short dashes, and strong jump attacks allow seamless transitions between zoning and offense, 
            enhancing both aspects of his gameplay.

          <h2 id="offense">Offense</h2>
          <p>
            his forward j.HP has strong priority over normals and most specials.<br>
            Dashing grounded attacks give him the ability to maintain pressure, even from a distance.<br><br>
            <u>safe blockstring:</u><br>  cr.LP x 2 > st.LK > slide > bomb
          </p>
          <h4>close. st.HP</h4>
          <p>close st.HP hits low, you can use it to trick your opponent while he’s standing.
            <br>example: (corner) j.HP > st.LP x 2 > st.HP > bomb > Super</p>

          <h2 id="projectiles">Projectiles</h2>
          <p>
            Use 236 LP (kunai) for fast, potent chipping and distance control. 
            It pierces through opponent projectiles (except Saizo).<br><br>
            236 HP (Bombs) are slower, but they recover much faster than other projectiles.
            They can be used more frequently to keep opponents pressured. <br><br>
            j.HP and neutral j.HP are both effective air-to-air attacks.
          </p>

          <h2 id="anti-air">Anti-air</h2>
          <p>
            <u>623P swords</u><br>
            If it hits a jumping opponent, it can be followed by a super.<br><br>
            <u>close st.HK</u><br>
            can be canceled into super flames or 623P swords<br><br>
            <u>214 LP</u><br>
            a reliable anti-air because of its invincibility frames.
          </p>

          <h2 id="breaker">Breaker</h2>
          <p>
            214 LP is your breaker move. It has an invincible startup and leads to Hair Super (236236 K). 
            Use with caution, you're at a disadvantage even on hit unless you confirm with a super.
          </p>


          
            <h2 id="st.hk">Stand HK</h2>
          <p>
            Saizo's strongest normal. It can be used for both defense and offense. 
            Additionally, there are far and close versions of the standing HK. 
            Understanding their triggering range is crucial, as the long-distance one can leave you vulnerable.
          </p>

    
            <h3 id="close_HK_offense">a) close HK on offense</h3>
          <p>
            On block and hit, close st.HK is positive, you can try to :
            <ul>
              <li>Continue your pressure (ex: st.HK > cr.LK)</li>
              <li>Or, wait/delay your following attack to bait a backdash/jump/reversal</li>
            </ul>
          Note: close st.HK has a small pushback on block, which keeps you out of the throw range.
          </p>
          
          <h3 id="close_HK_defense">b) close HK on defense</h3>
          <p>
          It’s a reliable anti-air, as it comes fast and has a large hitbox. 
          it leads to significant damage due to its special/super cancelable properties.
          Use 6HK for easier sword conversion. HK > 623HP becomes 6HK > 23HP.
        </p>

        <h2 id="super">Super usage</h2>
        <p>
          Musou Shinra: Long-range anti-air super, and extends juggle combos seamlessly
          <br><br>Musou Tenha : Summons a pillar of flames. The Light version is fixed directly in front of Saizo, while the Heavy version tracks the opponent
          <br><br>Senku Ensatsujin : Must-have super. Saizo dashes and executes an auto combo. Extremely fast startup; punishes most moves in the game. Cancelable out of light hair.

        </p>



          <h2 id="chip_damage">Chip damage</h2>
          
          <p>
            Chip with projectiles, swords, or hair (Yashagami).<br>
            Kunai (236LP) does more chip than bomb (236HP).
            Heavy Hair (214HP) and Sword HP (623HP) deal the most chip damage among all of Saizo's specials and supers.
          </p>

          <h2 id="pressings">Pressings</h2>
          <p>In all matchups, you can easily pressure your opponent with slide (LK+HK) into bomb</p>

          <h2 id="throw_os">throw/st.HK OS</h2>
          <p>
            Coupling Dash Guard with Back Throw (back+HP+HK) makes for an aggressive throw/anti-air option select.<br>
            <br><u>throw OS (4HP+HK) :</u><br>
            <ul>
              <li>if your opponent is trying to jump : back+HK (anti-air)</li>
              <li>if your opponent stays at throw-range : back+HP (throw)</li>
