          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Lee Dao-Long is Sho's rival and senior. A young Korean who practices a Chinese martial art called the "Empty
            Fist." He likes to eat spicy food and enjoys a long ride in the desert on camel's back.
          </p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>  
            Dao-long stands out as a charge character with strong defense and mobility. 
            His rapid charge input ensures smooth transitions between specials moves such as his fireball (Kouryuu Ga) 
            and Flash Kick (Senkyuu Tai), known for their invincibility frames. 
            He capitalizes on openings for high damage with light confirms and super juggles, 
            excelling in space control and punishing adversaries.
