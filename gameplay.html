            <img class="GIF" style="padding:10px; border:1px solid lightgray;" src="img/assets/arcadestick.png">
            <p>The KOF (King Of Fighters) layout, standard in arcades, is user-friendly, allowing easy execution of
               complex moves.</p>
            <h2>Throw</h2>
            <img class="GIF" src="img/GIF/how-to-play/throw.gif">
            <center>
               <div class="inputs">
               Press <img src="img/inputs/Arcade-Stick-Right.png">+<img src="img/inputs/Arcade-Button-CPunch.png"> or

            <p>
               Throws beats meaty normals<br>
               Some characters have additional throws inputs or air throws.
            </p>
            <h2>Tech rolling</h2>
            <img class="GIF" src="img/GIF/how-to-play/techroll.gif">
            <center>
               <div class="inputs">
               On wake-up, press 3 buttons<br> ex: <img src="img/inputs/Arcade-Button-APunch.png">+<img

            </div>
            </center>

            <p>
               Tech roll give you more options to escape from your opponent's pressure after a knockdown.<br>
               It only works after after a non-super hit<br>
               Tech rolls can also be delayed
            </p>
            <h2>Dashes</h2>
            <img class="GIF" src="img/GIF/how-to-play/dashes.gif">
            <center>
            <div class="inputs">

            </div>
            </center>
            <p>
               Backdashes and dashes build meter. All characters can perform dashes except Condor. Depending on the
               character, Certain backdashes are invincible. <br><br>
               Some characters can execute short dashes by interrupting them with a crouching attack or guard.
               Additionally, some dashes can be canceled into a jump, providing :
               <li>a longer forward jump</li>
               <li>a shorter back jump</li>
               <li>a slightly longer neutral jump</li>
               <br>Note: A slightly longer neutral jump can sets up ambiguous attacks on your opponent's wakeup.
            </p>
            <h2>Dizzy</h2>
            <img class="GIF" src="img/GIF/how-to-play/dizzy.gif">
            <div class="inputs">
               <center>To recover from a dizzy, mash buttons and directions.<center><br>
            </div>
            <p>
               You can be dizzied after repeated hits.<br>
               Your character will be invulnerable while he is recovering.<br>
               If you mash directions and buttons quickly enough, you will skip the dizzy state and start recovering
               immediately.
            </p>
            <h2>Chip damage</h2>
            <img class="GIF" src="img/GIF/how-to-play/chip.gif">
            <p>
               Chip damage refers to damage taken when blocking an attack<br>
               It can kill your opponent if they are low enough on health.<br><br>
               Note: Super moves will only deal a small amount of chip damage. To kill your opponent, special moves are
               a better choice.
            </p>
            <h2>Breakers</h2>
            <img class="GIF" src="img/GIF/how-to-play/breakers.gif">
            <figcaption>Sho is doing a fake (breakable) combo, even if Rila gets hit, she can punish Sho immediately
               after his st.HP. The green circle underneath Rila signals a successful Breaker, the same goes for wakeup
               reversals.</figcaption>
            <p>
               <b>Breaker is a defensive mechanic that allows you to break out of specific combos. This can be achieved using certain specials, normals, backdashes, throws, or supers</b><br><br>
               Most character have breakable and unbreakable combos. Check <a href="characters.html">character
                  guide</a> for more infos !<br>
               <br>
               Master unbreakable combos for guaranteed damage and practice recognizing breakable combos from your
               opponent.<br>
               In high-level matches, this mechanic is often used as mind games (ex: bait defenders into reversals) <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Risk system</h2>
            <img class="GIF" src="img/GIF/how-to-play/risk.gif">
            <p>
               <b>The Risk System increases the damage of your next attack over time when you are not attacking or
               defending.</b><br>
               The damage cap is different for each character.<br><br>
               Once the damage cap is reached (around 30 sec in-game) your next hit will likely be about double.<br><br>
               The winner of a round has less damage resistance in the next round, while the loser has slightly
               increased defense.<br>
               When there is a significant difference in health, the player with less health is immune to damage mod
               until both players have similar health.
