    <h1>Breaker's Revenge</h1>


    <p>
      Breaker's Revenge is a lesser-known fighting game released in 1998 for the Neo Geo platform, developed by Visco
      Corporation. It's a sequel to "Breakers," which was released a year earlier.

    <p>
      The game features a roster of characters with unique fighting styles and special moves. Like many fighting games
      of its time, it offered both arcade and versus mode, where players could battle against each other. The gameplay
      mechanics were somewhat reminiscent of other popular fighting games of the era, with a focus on combos, special
      moves, and flashy attacks.<br><br>

      While Breaker's Revenge didn't achieve the same level of popularity as some of its contemporaries, it still holds
      a place in the hearts of retro gaming enthusiasts and fans of the Neo Geo.
