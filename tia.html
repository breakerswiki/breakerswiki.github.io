          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Tia Langray, a Thai kickboxer, embarks on a quest to find her brother, unaware that he encountered Bai-Hu
            and met a tragic end. Sho, a character in the game, reminds her of her brother, a fact she acknowledges.
          </p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            Tia is a fast fighter that can quickly switch directions on opponents to slip through their defense. Her
            dash jab pressure is very strong and she has excellent conversions off of stray hits. Opponents will be
            forced to use a breaker to get out of her pressure or risk being put in the corner. Using Rapid charge
            (Super) she can be a threat from anywhere on the screen. She also has a good fireball and poke game.
          </p>

          <h2 id="antiair">Anti-air</h2>
          <p>anti-air with 623P or st.HK<br>
            both of which can be followed by super (Rapid charge)<br>
            Burning Revolver is also an effective way to punish jumps and cross-up attempts.
          </p>

          <h2 id="super">Super usage</h2>
          <p>
            Rapid charge super is used as a combo ender and to punish opponent's unsafe moves and projectiles effectively
          </p>
          <p>
            Burning Revolver can be utilized as a combo finisher, 
            usable both in the air and on the ground. 
            Thanks to its invulnerability during startup, 
            it functions as a baiting tool for reversals or frametraps. 
            Upon hitting, it directs opponents towards the corner.
          </p>

          <h2 id="dash">Dash pressure</h2>
          <u>short dash jab</u>
          <p>If executed correctly, this pressure leaves no gap and allows you to maintain the advantage while also
            charging your super bar.</p>

          <u>dash far st.HK</u>
          <p>far st.HK is safe on block and doubles as an anti-air. Hit airborne opponents for a super juggle.</p>

          <u>dash st.HP</u>
          <p>far st.HP is safe on block. Hit airborne opponents and confirm it with Soul Spike (214K) for a super juggle
          </p>

                Yashagami HP knocks down opponents, while Yashagami LP serves as a reversal and anti-air.
                This move must be canceled into a super due to its negative frames on hit and block.
                Be cautious on block; Saizo still has a few frames to execute a super, 
                causing hesitation in your usual punishment. 
                In such instances, your Super (236236P) ensures a guaranteed punish
